LZFSE is a lossless compression algorithm made by engineers at Apple. Their main principle was energy efficiency while maintaining speed and compression ratio. The result is a quite CPU efficient compression algorithm, which cached our eyes during research. We want logga to utilize as little system resource as possible, so lzfse seemed like an an obvious iteration after gzip.</p><h2 id="what-does-it-mean-for-you" tabindex="-1">What does it mean for you? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-it-mean-for-you" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What does it mean for you?&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Not only logga uses less cpu cycles to achive a better compression ratio, based on our measurements logga compresses a 10MB log file to 120KB!
